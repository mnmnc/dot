# Try playing around with the HSB colour selection model. 
# In HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), Hues (H) are laid out in a circular fashion, 
# with their H values varying between 0 degrees (red) and 360 degrees (red again). 
# If you want a colour's complementary hue, sample its H value and add 180 degrees to it 
# (or subtract 180, whichever gives a valuw between 0 and 360) to get the complementary. 
# Thus, red (H=0) has a complementary in cyan (H=180).
